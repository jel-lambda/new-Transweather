## Datasets:

### Train Data:

TransWeather is trained on a combination of images sampled from Outdoor-Rain, Snow100K, and Raindrop datasets (similar to [All-in-One (CVPR 2020)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Li_All_in_One_Bad_Weather_Removal_Using_Architectural_Search_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf)), dubbed as "All-Weather", containing 18069 images. It can be downloaded from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tfeBnjZX1wIhIFPl6HOzzOKOyo0GdGHl/view?usp=sharing).


### Dataset format:

Download the datasets and arrange them in the following format.

```
    TransWeather
    ├── data 
    |   ├── train # Training  
    |   |   ├── <dataset_name>   
    |   |   |   ├── input         # rain images 
    |   |   |   └── gt            # clean images
    |   |   └── dataset_filename.txt
    |   └── test  # Testing         
    |   |   ├── <dataset_name>          
    |   |   |   ├── input         # rain images 
    |   |   |   └── gt            # clean images
    |   |   └── dataset_filename.txt
```
- format which will be applicated later

## Evaluation Code:


To run the evaluation for specific test datasets, run the following commands:

```   
python test_snow100k.py -exp_name TransWeather_weights
```

```   
python test_test1.py -exp_name TransWeather_weights
```

```   
python test_raindropa.py -exp_name TransWeather_weights
```

These scripts will calculate the performance metrics as well as save the predictions in the results folder.


## Training the network:

To train the network on All-weather dataset, run the following command:

```
python train.py  -train_batch_size 32 -exp_name Transweather -epoch_start 0 -num_epochs 250
```

## Extensions:

Note that Transweather is built to solve all adverse weather problem with a single model. We observe that, additionally TransWeather can be easilty modified (removing the transformer decoder) to just focus on an individual restoration task. To train just the Transweather-encoder on other datasets (like Rain-800), organize the dataset similar to all-weather and run the following command: 

```
python train-individual.py  -train_batch_size 32 -exp_name Transweather-finetune -epoch_start 0 -num_epochs 250
```

Change ```train-individual.py``` with the necesarry details of the data to be trained on. Note that the network used there is a sub-section of our original Transweather architecture without the weather queries.
